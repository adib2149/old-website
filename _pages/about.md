I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. (2nd year) in Computational Sciences at Marquette University.

Working under the supervision of my Ph.D. Supervisor, [Dr. Sheikh Iqbal Ahamed](http://www.marquette.edu/mscs/facstaff-ahamed.shtml){:target="\_blank"}, I am actively working on several projects involving `causal inference`, `mobile health and computing`, `ubiquitous computing`, `crisis management` etc. in the [Ubicomp Lab](http://ubicomp.mscs.mu.edu/){:target="\_blank"}, at [Marquette University](http://marquette.edu/){:target="\_blank"}. Here's a list of all the projects I am working on.

<!-- Currently involved in:
<ul>
    <li>Application of Causal Inference on delirium patients in the ICU</li>
    <li>mHealth solutions in Crisis Management for U.S. Veterans</li>
    <li>myFAMI</li>
    <li>E-PED</li>
</ul> -->

<!-- Before coming to US, I worked as the Android Lead at a Dhaka-based local startup in restaurant discovery service, [Harriken.com Limited](https://harriken.com){:target="\_blank"}. I finished my undergrad in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from [Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology](http://buet.ac.bd/){:target="\_blank"}. I finished my High school from [Jhenidah Cadet College](https://jcc.army.mil.bd/){:target="\_blank"}. -->

When I am not down at the lab, I enjoy my free time mostly by singing. My hobbies include reading, playing guitar, experimenting with electronics and electronic gadgets, playing basketball, playing xbox, writing blogs and some more.
