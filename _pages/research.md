<h3>Research Interest</h3>

<b>`Causal Inference`, `Structural Causal Model`, `Survival Analysis`, `Transportability`, `Artificial Intelligence`, `Machine Learning`, `Data Science`</b>

I was introduced to the world of `Causal Inference` <i>(by Dr. Adibuzzaman)</i> in 2018. I was immediately hooked to the fascinating works of Pearl, Elias, Rubin, Hernan, and many other researchers working relentlessly in this field. It has been a rabbit hole from there, and the more I learn, the more I find there is left to answer. I firmly believe `Causal Inference` is going to be one of the strongest pillars of data science in the next decades, and that is why I have decided to pursue this and make it my Ph.D. dissertation work. I am currently exploring theories of `Causal Inference`, finding novel ways to capture `Survival Analysis` using it, and applying these in exploring the efficacy of Antipsychotic drugs in the treatment of Delirium by emulating Randomized Controlled Trials from an observational dataset.
